      <h2>Who Was He?</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela wasn’t just a leader — he was a symbol of resilience, hope, and forgiveness.
        Born in 1918 in a small village in South Africa, Mandela’s journey from prisoner to president is one of the most inspiring stories the world has ever known.

      <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
      <p>
        I admire Nelson Mandela not just because he stood up to injustice — but because he forgave. After spending 27 years in prison,
        he emerged without bitterness and led South Africa into a new era of democracy and unity.
        That kind of strength and compassion is something I deeply respect.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Mandela taught us that real leadership comes from serving others — with courage, love, and humility.
        His life is a reminder that no matter where we come from, we can make a difference.
